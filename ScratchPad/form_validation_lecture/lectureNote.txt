different way to validate 
    - client server validation:
        * validate html form (Borwser Built-in validation)
            + spectify different type of input  <input type="email">  only email type is allowed
            + adding required attribute to the form will make the element mandatory to be filled 
            + you can specify the attribute minlength and maxlength to set the length of the text
            + min or max for number input type 
            + you can set the pattern to math what you want 
            the browser will prevent the form from submission if validation fails
                -  to tell the user that their form contains wrong input type, we can use css to visually show the customer 
                input:required:invalid
                :valid 
                :required 
                - we can use javascipt. then form will catch the excpetion when it is about to be submitted
                form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
 ...
                        if(validationFails) {
                            // prevent it from doing its befault behavior 
                            e.preventDefault();
                        }
                });
