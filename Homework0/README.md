# Homework 0: Thoughts on Ungrading

## 1. What are your thoughts on the Ungrading practice as it applies in general to teaching and learning (not necessarily specifically to this class)?

I am really looking forward to see how that is going to work as it is the first time I am going to experience it. I think it is going to be interesting to see the impact it would have on my overall performance. I hope it will help increase my performance as there will not be a lot of pressure on me to try and get the highest grade possible and help me focus on understanding the topics in a deeper way.

## 2. What are your thoughts on the way Ungrading will be applied to this class based on what has been explained by your instructor and what is described in the syllabus?

I think it is interesting in terms of using our analysis to judge our work. self-accountability is crutial in regards to using our own judgement to grade our work. it will enventually leads to a better understanding of what your strenghts are and what your weaknesseses are.

## 3. On the scale from 1 to 5, how confident are you in that you can earn an A in this class (1 is lowest, 5 is highest)?
 i would go with a 4.
